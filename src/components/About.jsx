        A full-stack developer who engineers products that are fast, scalable,
        and beautifully built. I design intuitive frontends with React and
        develop efficient, maintainable backends with Node.js. My work bridges
        logic and design, ensuring performance meets precision in every
        deployment.

        I focus on building clean architectures, seamless user experiences, and
        robust systems that evolve gracefully with scale. Every project I touch
        aims for clarity, consistency, and technical elegance.
